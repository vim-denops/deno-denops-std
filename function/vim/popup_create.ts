/**
 * Open a popup window showing **{what}**, which is either:
 * - a buffer number
 * - a string
 * - a list of strings
 * - a list of text lines with text properties
 * When **{what}** is not a buffer number, a buffer is created with
 * 'buftype' set to "popup".  That buffer will be wiped out once
 * the popup closes.
 *
 * if **{what}** is a buffer number and loading the buffer runs into
 * an existing swap file, it is silently opened read-only, as if
 * a `SwapExists` autocommand had set `v:swapchoice` to 'o'.
 * This is because we assume the buffer is only used for viewing.
 *
 * **{options}** is a dictionary with many possible entries.
 * See `popup_create-arguments` for details.
 *
 * Returns a window-ID, which can be used with other popup
 * functions.  Use `winbufnr()` to get the number of the buffer
 * in the window:
 *
 *     let winid = popup_create('hello', {})
 *     let bufnr = winbufnr(winid)
 *     call setbufline(bufnr, 2, 'second line')
 *
 * In case of failure zero is returned.
 *
 * Can also be used as a `method`:
 *
 *     GetText()->popup_create({})
 *
 * Return type: `Number`
