/**
 * Opens a new split window, or a floating window if `relative` is specified,
 * or an external window (managed by the UI) if `external` is specified.
 *
 * Floats are windows that are drawn above the split layout, at some anchor
 * position in some other window. Floats can be drawn internally or by
 * external GUI with the `ui-multigrid` extension. External windows are only
 * supported with multigrid GUIs, and are displayed as separate top-level
 * windows.
 *
 * For a general overview of floats, see `api-floatwin`.
 *
 * The `width` and `height` of the new window must be specified when opening
 * a floating window, but are optional for normal windows.
 *
 * If `relative` and `external` are omitted, a normal "split" window is
 * created. The `win` property determines which window will be split. If no
 * `win` is provided or `win == 0`, a window will be created adjacent to the
 * current window. If -1 is provided, a top-level split will be created.
 * `vertical` and `split` are only valid for normal windows, and are used to
 * control split direction. For `vertical`, the exact direction is determined
 * by `'splitright'` and `'splitbelow'`. Split windows cannot have
 * `bufpos`/`row`/`col`/`border`/`title`/`footer` properties.
 *
 * With relative=editor (row=0,col=0) refers to the top-left corner of the
 * screen-grid and (row=Lines-1,col=Columns-1) refers to the bottom-right
 * corner. Fractional values are allowed, but the builtin implementation
 * (used by non-multigrid UIs) will always round down to nearest integer.
 *
 * Out-of-bounds values, and configurations that make the float not fit
 * inside the main editor, are allowed. The builtin implementation truncates
 * values so floats are fully within the main screen grid. External GUIs
 * could let floats hover outside of the main window like a tooltip, but this
 * should not be used to specify arbitrary WM screen positions.
 *
 * Example (Lua): window-relative float
 *
 *     vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false,
 *       {relative='win', row=3, col=3, width=12, height=3})
 *
 * Example (Lua): buffer-relative float (travels as buffer is scrolled)
 *
 *     vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false,
 *       {relative='win', width=12, height=3, bufpos={100,10}})
 *
 * Example (Lua): vertical split left of the current window
 *
 *     vim.api.nvim_open_win(0, false, {
 *       split = 'left',
 *       win = 0
 *     })
 *
 * Attributes:
 *     not allowed when `textlock` is active
 *     Since: 0.4.0
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   - **{buffer}**  Buffer to display, or 0 for current buffer
 *   - **{enter}**   Enter the window (make it the current window)
 *   - **{config}**  Map defining the window configuration. Keys:
 *               - relative: Sets the window layout to "floating", placed at
 *                 (row,col) coordinates relative to:
 *                 - "cursor" Cursor position in current window.
 *                 - "editor" The global editor grid.
 *                 - "laststatus" 'laststatus' if present, or last row.
 *                 - "mouse" Mouse position.
 *                 - "tabline" Tabline if present, or first row.
 *                 - "win" Window given by the `win` field, or current
 *                   window.
 *               - win: `window-ID` window to split, or relative window when
 *                 creating a float (relative="win").
 *               - anchor: Decides which corner of the float to place at
 *                 (row,col):
 *                 - "NW" northwest (default)
 *                 - "NE" northeast
 *                 - "SW" southwest
 *                 - "SE" southeast
 *               - width: Window width (in character cells). Minimum of 1.
 *               - height: Window height (in character cells). Minimum of 1.
 *               - bufpos: Places float relative to buffer text (only when
 *                 relative="win"). Takes a tuple of zero-indexed
 *                 `[line, column]`. `row` and `col` if given are applied
 *                 relative to this position, else they default to:
 *                 - `row=1` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "NW" or "NE"
 *                 - `row=0` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "SW" or "SE" (thus
 *                   like a tooltip near the buffer text).
 *               - row: Row position in units of "screen cell height", may be
 *                 fractional.
 *               - col: Column position in units of "screen cell width", may
 *                 be fractional.
 *               - focusable: Enable focus by user actions (wincmds, mouse
 *                 events). Defaults to true. Non-focusable windows can be
 *                 entered by `nvim_set_current_win()`, or, when the `mouse`
 *                 field is set to true, by mouse events. See `focusable`.
 *               - mouse: Specify how this window interacts with mouse
 *                 events. Defaults to `focusable` value.
 *                 - If false, mouse events pass through this window.
 *                 - If true, mouse events interact with this window
 *                   normally.
 *               - external: GUI should display the window as an external
 *                 top-level window. Currently accepts no other positioning
 *                 configuration together with this.
 *               - zindex: Stacking order. floats with higher `zindex` go on
 *                 top on floats with lower indices. Must be larger than
 *                 zero. The following screen elements have hard-coded
 *                 z-indices:
 *                 - 100: insert completion popupmenu
 *                 - 200: message scrollback
 *                 - 250: cmdline completion popupmenu (when
 *                   wildoptions+=pum) The default value for floats are 50.
 *                   In general, values below 100 are recommended, unless
 *                   there is a good reason to overshadow builtin elements.
 *               - style: (optional) Configure the appearance of the window.
 *                 Currently only supports one value:
 *                 - "minimal" Nvim will display the window with many UI
 *                   options disabled. This is useful when displaying a
 *                   temporary float where the text should not be edited.
 *                   Disables 'number', 'relativenumber', 'cursorline',
 *                   'cursorcolumn', 'foldcolumn', 'spell' and 'list'
 *                   options. 'signcolumn' is changed to `auto` and
 *                   'colorcolumn' is cleared. 'statuscolumn' is changed to
 *                   empty. The end-of-buffer region is hidden by setting
 *                   `eob` flag of 'fillchars' to a space char, and clearing
 *                   the `hl-EndOfBuffer` region in 'winhighlight'.
 *               - border: Style of (optional) window border. This can either
 *                 be a string or an array. The string values are the same as
 *                 those described in 'winborder'. If it is an array, it
 *                 should have a length of eight or any divisor of eight. The
 *                 array will specify the eight chars building up the border
 *                 in a clockwise fashion starting with the top-left corner.
 *                 As an example, the double box style could be specified as:
 *
 *                     [ "╔", "═" ,"╗", "║", "╝", "═", "╚", "║" ].
 *
 *                 If the number of chars are less than eight, they will be
 *                 repeated. Thus an ASCII border could be specified as
 *
 *                     [ "/", "-", \"\\\\\", "|" ],
 *
 *                 or all chars the same as
 *
 *                     [ "x" ].
 *
 *                 An empty string can be used to turn off a specific border,
 *                 for instance,
 *
 *                     [ "", "", "", ">", "", "", "", "<" ]
 *
 *                 will only make vertical borders but not horizontal ones.
 *                 By default, `FloatBorder` highlight is used, which links
 *                 to `WinSeparator` when not defined. It could also be
 *                 specified by character:
 *
 *                     [ ["+", "MyCorner"], ["x", "MyBorder"] ].
 *
 *               - title: Title (optional) in window border, string or list.
 *                 List should consist of `[text, highlight]` tuples. If
 *                 string, or a tuple lacks a highlight, the default
 *                 highlight group is `FloatTitle`.
 *               - title_pos: Title position. Must be set with `title`
 *                 option. Value can be one of "left", "center", or "right".
 *                 Default is `"left"`.
 *               - footer: Footer (optional) in window border, string or
 *                 list. List should consist of `[text, highlight]` tuples.
 *                 If string, or a tuple lacks a highlight, the default
 *                 highlight group is `FloatFooter`.
 *               - footer_pos: Footer position. Must be set with `footer`
 *                 option. Value can be one of "left", "center", or "right".
 *                 Default is `"left"`.
 *               - noautocmd: If true then all autocommands are blocked for
 *                 the duration of the call.
 *               - fixed: If true when anchor is NW or SW, the float window
 *                 would be kept fixed even if the window would be truncated.
 *               - hide: If true the floating window will be hidden.
 *               - vertical: Split vertically `:vertical`.
 *               - split: Split direction: "left", "right", "above", "below".
 *
 * Return:
 *     `window-ID`, or 0 on error
