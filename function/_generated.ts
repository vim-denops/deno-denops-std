/**
 * confirm() offers the user a dialog, from which a choice can be

 * choice this is 1.
 * Note: confirm() is only supported when compiled with dialog
 * support, see `+dialog_con` `+dialog_con_gui` and `+dialog_gui`.
 *
 * **{msg}** is displayed in a `dialog` with **{choices}** as the
 * alternatives.  When **{choices}** is missing or empty, "&OK" is
 * used (and translated).
 * **{msg}** is a String, use '\n' to include a newline.  Only on
 * some systems the string is wrapped when it doesn't fit.
 *
 * **{choices}** is a String, with the individual choices separated
 * by '\n', e.g.
 *
 *     confirm("Save changes?", "&Yes\n&No\n&Cancel")
 *
 * The letter after the '&' is the shortcut key for that choice.
 * Thus you can type 'c' to select "Cancel".  The shortcut does
 * not need to be the first letter:
 *
 *     confirm("file has been modified", "&Save\nSave &All")
 *
 * For the console, the first letter of each choice is used as
 * the default shortcut key.  Case is ignored.
 *
 * The optional **{default}** argument is the number of the choice
 * that is made if the user hits `<CR>`.  Use 1 to make the first
 * choice the default one.  Use 0 to not set a default.  If
 * **{default}** is omitted, 1 is used.
 *
 * The optional **{type}** String argument gives the type of dialog.
 * This is only used for the icon of the GTK, Mac, Motif and
 * Win32 GUI.  It can be one of these values: "Error",
 * "Question", "Info", "Warning" or "Generic".  Only the first
 * character is relevant.  When **{type}** is omitted, "Generic" is
 * used.
 *
 * If the user aborts the dialog by pressing `<Esc>`, CTRL-C,
 * or another valid interrupt key, confirm() returns 0.
 *
 * An example:
 *
 *     let choice = confirm("What do you want?",
 *                          \ "&Apples\n&Oranges\n&Bananas", 2)
 *     if choice == 0
 *          echo "make up your mind!"
 *     elseif choice == 3
 *          echo "tasteful"
 *     else
 *          echo "I prefer bananas myself."
 *     endif
 *
 * In a GUI dialog, buttons are used.  The layout of the buttons
 * depends on the 'v' flag in 'guioptions'.  If it is included,
 * the buttons are always put vertically.  Otherwise,  confirm()
 * tries to put the buttons in one horizontal line.  If they
 * don't fit, a vertical layout is used anyway.  For some systems
 * the horizontal layout is always used.
 *
 * Can also be used as a `method`in:
 *

 *
 * When **{string}** starts with '%', '#' or `'<'`, the expansion is

 *         `<sfile>`         sourced script file or function name

 *         `<script>`        sourced script file, or script file
 *                         where the current function was defined
 *         `<stack>`         call stack
 *         `<cword>`         word under the cursor
 *         `<cWORD>`         WORD under the cursor
 *         `<client>`        the **{clientid}** of the last received
 *                         message `server2client()`
 * Modifiers:
 *         :p              expand to full path
 *         :h              head (last path component removed)
 *         :t              tail (last path component only)
 *         :r              root (one extension removed)
 *         :e              extension only
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     :let &tags = expand("%:p:h") .. "/tags"
 *
 * Note that when expanding a string that starts with '%', '#' or
 * `'<'`, any following text is ignored.  This does NOT work:
 *
 *     :let doesntwork = expand("%:h.bak")
 *
 * Use this:
 *
 *     :let doeswork = expand("%:h") .. ".bak"
 *
 * Also note that expanding `"<cfile>"` and others only returns the
 * referenced file name without further expansion.  If `"<cfile>"`
 * is `"~/.cshrc"`, you need to do another expand() to have the
 * `"~/"` expanded into the path of the home directory:
 *
 *     :echo expand(expand("<cfile>"))
 *
 * There cannot be white space between the variables and the
 * following modifier.  The `fnamemodify()` function can be used
 * to modify normal file names.
 *
 * When using '%' or '#', and the current or alternate file name
 * is not defined, an empty string is used.  Using "%:p" in a
 * buffer with no name, results in the current directory, with a
 * '/' added.
 * When 'verbose' is set then expanding '%', '#' and `<>` items
 * will result in an error message if the argument cannot be
 * expanded.
 *
 * When **{string}** does not start with '%', '#' or `'<'`, it is
 * expanded like a file name is expanded on the command line.
 * 'suffixes' and 'wildignore' are used, unless the optional
 * **{nosuf}** argument is given and it is `TRUE`.
 * Names for non-existing files are included.  The "**" item can
 * be used to search in a directory tree.  For example, to find
 * all "README" files in the current directory and below:
 *
 *     :echo expand("** /README")
 *
 * expand() can also be used to expand variables and environment
 * variables that are only known in a shell.  But this can be
 * slow, because a shell may be used to do the expansion.  See
 * `expr-env-expand`.
 * The expanded variable is still handled like a list of file
 * names.  When an environment variable cannot be expanded, it is
 * left unchanged.  Thus ":echo expand('$FOOBAR')" results in
 * "$FOOBAR".
 *
 * See `glob()` for finding existing files.  See `system()` for
 * getting the raw output of an external command.
 *
 * Can also be used as a `method`:
 *
 *     Getpattern()->expand()
 *

/**
 * Characters in **{string}** are queued for processing as if they
 * come from a mapping or were typed by the user.
 *
 * By default the string is added to the end of the typeahead
 * buffer, thus if a mapping is still being executed the
 * characters come after them.  Use the 'i' flag to insert before
 * other characters, they will be executed next, before any
 * characters from a mapping.
 *
 * The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in
 * **{string}**.
 *
 * To include special keys into **{string}**, use double-quotes
 * and "\..." notation `expr-quote`. For example,
 * feedkeys(`"\<CR>"`) simulates pressing of the `<Enter>` key. But
 * feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
 * A special code that might be useful is `<Ignore>`, it exits the
 * wait for a character without doing anything.
 *
 * **{mode}** is a String, which can contain these character flags:
 * 'm'     Remap keys. This is default.  If **{mode}** is absent,
 *         keys are remapped.
 * 'n'     Do not remap keys.
 * 't'     Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
 *         if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
 *         opening folds, etc.
 * 'L'     Lowlevel input.  Only works for Unix or when using the
 *         GUI. Keys are used as if they were coming from the
 *         terminal.  Other flags are not used.
 *         When a CTRL-C interrupts and 't' is included it sets
 *         the internal "got_int" flag.
 * 'i'     Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
 * 'x'     Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
 *         similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
 *         several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
 *         (possibly with an empty **{string}**) to execute all the
 *         typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
 *         will behave as if `<Esc>` is typed, to avoid getting
 *         stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
 *         script continues.
 *         Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
 *         executing commands, thus calling it recursively, then
 *         all typeahead will be consumed by the last call.
 * 'c'     Remove any script context when executing, so that
 *         legacy script syntax applies, "s:var" does not work,
 *         etc.  Note that if the string being fed sets a script
 *         context this still applies.
 * '!'     When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be

 *         a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.

 *     eval 'one'->Partial('three')
 *
 * Invokes the function as with:

 *     "...
 *     let Func = function('Callback', ['one'])

 *     call Func2('name')
 *
 * Invokes the function as with:
 *
 *     call Callback('one', 'two', 'name')
 *
 * The Dictionary is only useful when calling a "dict" function.
 * In that case the **{dict}** is passed in as "self". Example:
 *
 *     function Callback() dict
 *        echo "called for " .. self.name
 *     endfunction
 *     "...
 *     let context = {"name": "example"}
 *     let Func = function('Callback', context)
 *     "...
 *     call Func()     " will echo: called for example
 *
 * The use of function() is not needed when there are no extra
 * arguments, these two are equivalent, if Callback() is defined
 * as context.Callback():
 *
 *     let Func = function('Callback', context)
 *     let Func = context.Callback

/**
 * Get a single character from the user or input stream.
 * If **{expr}** is omitted or is -1, wait until a character is
 *         available.
 * If **{expr}** is 0, only get a character when one is available.
 *         Return zero otherwise.
 * If **{expr}** is 1, only check if a character is available, it is
 *         not consumed.  Return zero if no character available.
 * If you prefer always getting a string use `getcharstr()`, or
 * specify `FALSE` as "number" in **{opts}**.
 *
 * Without **{expr}** and when **{expr}** is 0 a whole character or
 * special key is returned.  If it is a single character, the
 * result is a Number.  Use `nr2char()` to convert it to a String.
 * Otherwise a String is returned with the encoded character.
 * For a special key it's a String with a sequence of bytes
 * starting with 0x80 (decimal: 128).  This is the same value as
 * the String `"\<Key>"`, e.g., `"\<Left>"`.  The returned value is
 * also a String when a modifier (shift, control, alt) was used
 * that is not included in the character.  `keytrans()` can also
 * be used to convert a returned String into a readable form.
 *
 * When **{expr}** is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay
 * while Vim waits to see if this is the start of an escape
 * sequence.
 *
 * When **{expr}** is 1 only the first byte is returned.  For a
 * one-byte character it is the character itself as a number.
 * Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
 *
 * Use getcharmod() to obtain any additional modifiers.
 *
 * The optional argument **{opts}** is a Dict and supports the
 * following items:
 *
 *         cursor          A String specifying cursor behavior
 *                         when waiting for a character.
 *                         "hide": hide the cursor.
 *                         "keep": keep current cursor unchanged.
 *                         "msg": move cursor to message area.
 *                         (default: "msg")
 *
 *         number          If `TRUE`, return a Number when getting
 *                         a single character.
 *                         If `FALSE`, the return value is always
 *                         converted to a String, and an empty
 *                         String (instead of 0) is returned when
 *                         no character is available.
 *                         (default: `TRUE`)
 *
 *         simplify        If `TRUE`, include modifiers in the
 *                         character if possible.  E.g., return
 *                         the same value for CTRL-I and `<Tab>`.
 *                         If `FALSE`, don't include modifiers in
 *                         the character.
 *                         (default: `TRUE`)
 *
 * When the user clicks a mouse button, the mouse event will be
 * returned.  The position can then be found in `v:mouse_col`,
 * `v:mouse_lnum`, `v:mouse_winid` and `v:mouse_win`.
 * `getmousepos()` can also be used.  Mouse move events will be
 * ignored.
 * This example positions the mouse as it would normally happen:
 *
 *     let c = getchar()
 *     if c == "\<LeftMouse>" && v:mouse_win > 0
 *       exe v:mouse_win .. "wincmd w"
 *       exe v:mouse_lnum
 *       exe "normal " .. v:mouse_col .. "|"
 *     endif
 *
 * When using bracketed paste only the first character is
 * returned, the rest of the pasted text is dropped.
 * `xterm-bracketed-paste`.
 *
 * There is no prompt, you will somehow have to make clear to the
 * user that a character has to be typed.  The screen is not
 * redrawn, e.g. when resizing the window.  When using a popup
 * window it should work better with a `popup-filter`.
 *
 * There is no mapping for the character.
 * Key codes are replaced, thus when the user presses the `<Del>`
 * key you get the code for the `<Del>` key, not the raw character
 * sequence.  Examples:
 *
 *     getchar() == "\<Del>"
 *     getchar() == "\<S-Left>"
 *
 * This example redefines "f" to ignore case:
 *
 *     :nmap f :call FindChar()<CR>
 *     :function FindChar()
 *     :  let c = nr2char(getchar())
 *     :  while col('.') < col('$') - 1
 *     :    normal l
 *     :    if getline('.')[col('.') - 1] ==? c
 *     :      break
 *     :    endif
 *     :  endwhile
 *     :endfunction
 *
 * You may also receive synthetic characters, such as
 * `<CursorHold>`. Often you will want to ignore this and get
 * another character:
 *
 *     :function GetKey()
 *     :  let c = getchar()
 *     :  while c == "\<CursorHold>"
 *     :    let c = getchar()
 *     :  endwhile
 *     :  return c
 *     :endfunction
 *
 * Return type: `Number` or `String`

/**
 * Call function **{funcname}** in the run-time library **{libname}**
 * with single argument **{argument}**.
 * This is useful to call functions in a library that you
 * especially made to be used with Vim.  Since only one argument
 * is possible, calling standard library functions is rather
 * limited.
 * The result is the String returned by the function.  If the
 * function returns NULL, this will appear as an empty string ""
 * to Vim.
 * If the function returns a number, use libcallnr()!
 * If **{argument}** is a number, it is passed to the function as an
 * int; if **{argument}** is a string, it is passed as a
 * null-terminated string.
 * This function will fail in `restricted-mode`.
 *
 * libcall() allows you to write your own 'plug-in' extensions to
 * Vim without having to recompile the program.  It is NOT a
 * means to call system functions!  If you try to do so Vim will
 * very probably crash.
 *
 * For Win32, the functions you write must be placed in a DLL
 * and use the normal C calling convention (NOT Pascal which is
 * used in Windows System DLLs).  The function must take exactly
 * one parameter, either a character pointer or a long integer,
 * and must return a character pointer or NULL.  The character
 * pointer returned must point to memory that will remain valid
 * after the function has returned (e.g. in static data in the
 * DLL).  If it points to allocated memory, that memory will
 * leak away.  Using a static buffer in the function should work,
 * it's then freed when the DLL is unloaded.
 *
 * WARNING: If the function returns a non-valid pointer, Vim may
 * crash!  This also happens if the function returns a number,
 * because Vim thinks it's a pointer.
 * For Win32 systems, **{libname}** should be the filename of the DLL
 * without the ".DLL" suffix.  A full path is only required if
 * the DLL is not in the usual places.
 * For Unix: When compiling your own plugins, remember that the
 * object code must be compiled as position-independent ('PIC').
 * *only in Win32 and some Unix versions, when the `+libcall`
 * feature is present*
 * Examples:
 *
 *     :echo libcall("libc.so", "getenv", "HOME")

 * If the item type changes you may want to use `mapnew()` to
 * create a new List or Dictionary.  This is required when using

 *
 * **{expr2}** must be a `String` or `Funcref`.
 *
 * If **{expr2}** is a `String`, inside **{expr2}** `v:val` has the value
 * of the current item.  For a `Dictionary` `v:key` has the key
 * of the current item and for a `List` `v:key` has the index of
 * the current item.  For a `Blob` `v:key` has the index of the

 * Example:
 *
 *     :call map(mylist, '"> " .. v:val .. " <"')
 *
 * This puts "> " before and " <" after each item in "mylist".

 * still have to double ' quotes
 *
 * If **{expr2}** is a `Funcref` it is called with two arguments:
 *         1. The key or the index of the current item.
 *         2. the value of the current item.
 * With a legacy script lambda you don't get an error if it only
 * accepts one argument, but with a Vim9 lambda you get "E1106:
 * One argument too many", the number of arguments must match.
 *
 * The function must return the new value of the item. Example
 * that changes each value by "key-value":
 *
 *     func KeyValue(key, val)
 *       return a:key .. '-' .. a:val
 *     endfunc
 *     call map(myDict, function('KeyValue'))

 *
 *     call map(myDict, {key, val -> key .. '-' .. val})
 *
 * If you do not use "val" you can leave it out:
 *
 *     call map(myDict, {key -> 'item: ' .. key})
 *
 * If you do not use "key" you can use a short name:
 *
 *     call map(myDict, {_, val -> 'item: ' .. val})
 *
 * The operation is done in-place for a `List` and `Dictionary`.
 * If you want it to remain unmodified make a copy first:
 *
 *     :let tlist = map(copy(mylist), ' v:val .. "\t"')
 *
 * Returns **{expr1}**, the `List` or `Dictionary` that was filtered,
 * or a new `Blob` or `String`.
 * When an error is encountered while evaluating **{expr2}** no
 * further items in **{expr1}** are processed.
 * When **{expr2}** is a Funcref errors inside a function are ignored,
 * unless it was defined with the "abort" flag.
 *

 *     :let idx = match(haystack, '\cneedle')
 *
 * If **{start}** is given, the search starts from byte index
 * **{start}** in a String or item **{start}** in a `List`.
 * The result, however, is still the index counted from the
 * first character/item.  Example:
 *
 *     :echo match("testing", "ing", 2)
 *
 * result is again "4".
 *
 *     :echo match("testing", "ing", 4)
 *
 * result is again "4".
 *
 *     :echo match("testing", "t", 2)
 *
 * result is "3".
 * For a String, if **{start}** > 0 then it is like the string starts
 * **{start}** bytes later, thus "^" will match at **{start}**.  Except
 * when **{count}** is given, then it's like matches before the
 * **{start}** byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
 * backwards compatible).
 * For a String, if **{start}** < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
 * the index is counted from the end.
 * If **{start}** is out of range (**{start}** > strlen(**{expr}**) for a
 * String or **{start}** > len(**{expr}**) for a `List`) -1 is returned.
 *
 * When **{count}** is given use the **{count}**'th match.  When a match
 * is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
 * character further.  Thus this example results in 1:
 *
 *     echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
 *
 * In a `List` the search continues in the next item.
 * Note that when **{count}** is added the way **{start}** works changes,
 * see above.
 *
 * See `pattern` for the patterns that are accepted.
 * The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
 * the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.  The matching is always
 * done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.
 * Note that a match at the start is preferred, thus when the
 * pattern is using "*" (any number of matches) it tends to find
 * zero matches at the start instead of a number of matches
 * further down in the text.
 *
 * Can also be used as a `method`:
 *
 *     GetText()->match('word')
 *     GetList()->match('word')
 *
 * Return type: `Number`

/**
 * Defines a pattern to be highlighted in the current window (a
 * "match").  It will be highlighted with **{group}**.  Returns an
 * identification number (ID), which can be used to delete the
 * match using `matchdelete()`.  The ID is bound to the window.
 * Matching is case sensitive and magic, unless case sensitivity
 * or magicness are explicitly overridden in **{pattern}**.  The
 * 'magic', 'smartcase' and 'ignorecase' options are not used.
 * The "Conceal" value is special, it causes the match to be
 * concealed.
 *
 * The optional **{priority}** argument assigns a priority to the
 * match.  A match with a high priority will have its
 * highlighting overrule that of a match with a lower priority.
 * A priority is specified as an integer (negative numbers are no
 * exception).  If the **{priority}** argument is not specified, the
 * default priority is 10.  The priority of 'hlsearch' is zero,
 * hence all matches with a priority greater than zero will
 * overrule it.  Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is a separate
 * mechanism, and regardless of the chosen priority a match will
 * always overrule syntax highlighting.
 *
 * The optional **{id}** argument allows the request for a specific
 * match ID.  If a specified ID is already taken, an error
 * message will appear and the match will not be added.  An ID
 * is specified as a positive integer (zero excluded).  IDs 1, 2
 * and 3 are reserved for `:match`, `:2match` and `:3match`,
 * respectively.  3 is reserved for use by the `matchparen`
 * plugin.
 * If the **{id}** argument is not specified or -1, `matchadd()`
 * automatically chooses a free ID, which is at least 1000.
 *
 * The optional **{dict}** argument allows for further custom
 * values. Currently this is used to specify a match specific
 * conceal character that will be shown for `hl-Conceal`
 * highlighted matches. The dict can have the following members:
 *
 *         conceal     Special character to show instead of the
 *                     match (only for `hl-Conceal` highlighted
 *                     matches, see `:syn-cchar`)
 *         window      Instead of the current window use the
 *                     window with this number or window ID.
 *
 * The number of matches is not limited, as it is the case with
 * the `:match` commands.
 *
 * Returns -1 on error.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     :highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
 *     :let m = matchadd("MyGroup", "TODO")
 *
 * Deletion of the pattern:
 *
 *     :call matchdelete(m)
 *
 * A list of matches defined by `matchadd()` and `:match` are
 * available from `getmatches()`.  All matches can be deleted in

 *
 * pos-argument
 *         At most one positional argument specifier. These
 *         take the form {n$}, where n is >= 1.
 *
 * flags
 *         Zero or more of the following flags:
 *
 *     `#`         The value should be converted to an "alternate
 *               form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
 *               has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
 *               of the number is increased to force the first
 *               character of the output string to a zero (except
 *               if a zero value is printed with an explicit
 *               precision of zero).
 *               For b and B conversions, a non-zero result has
 *               the string "0b" (or "0B" for B conversions)
 *               prepended to it.
 *               For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
 *               the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
 *               prepended to it.
 *
 *     0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
 *               value is padded on the left with zeros rather
 *               than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
 *               numeric conversion (d, b, B, o, x, and X), the 0
 *               flag is ignored.
 *
 *     -         A negative field width flag; the converted value
 *               is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
 *               The converted value is padded on the right with
 *               blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
 *               zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.
 *
 *     ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
 *               number produced by a signed conversion (d).
 *
 *     +         A sign must always be placed before a number
 *               produced by a signed conversion.  A + overrides
 *               a space if both are used.
 *
 * field-width
 *         An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
 *         field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
 *         than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
 *         the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
 *         been given) to fill out the field width.  For the S
 *         conversion the count is in cells.
 *
 * .precision
 *         An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
 *         followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
 *         string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
 *         This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
 *         d, o, x, and X conversions, the maximum number of
 *         bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions,
 *         or the maximum number of cells to be printed from a
 *         string for S conversions.
 *         For floating point it is the number of digits after
 *         the decimal point.
 *
 * type
 *         A character that specifies the type of conversion to
 *         be applied, see below.
 *
 * A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
 * asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
 * Number argument supplies the field width or precision.  A
 * negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
 * followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
 * treated as though it were missing.  Example:
 *
 *     :echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
 *
 * This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
 * "width" bytes.
 *
 * If the argument to be formatted is specified using a
 * positional argument specifier, and a '*' is used to indicate
 * that a number argument is to be used to specify the width or
 * precision, the argument(s) to be used must also be specified
 * using a {n$} positional argument specifier. See `printf-$`.
 *
 * The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
 *
 * dbBoxX  The Number argument is converted to signed decimal
 *         (d), unsigned binary (b and B), unsigned octal (o), or
 *         unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters
 *         "abcdef" are used for x conversions; the letters
 *         "ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.
 *         The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of
 *         digits that must appear; if the converted value
 *         requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with
 *         zeros.
 *         In no case does a non-existent or small field width
 *         cause truncation of a numeric field; if the result of
 *         a conversion is wider than the field width, the field
 *         is expanded to contain the conversion result.
 *         The 'h' modifier indicates the argument is 16 bits.
 *         The 'l' modifier indicates the argument is a long
 *         integer.  The size will be 32 bits or 64 bits
 *         depending on your platform.
 *         The "ll" modifier indicates the argument is 64 bits.
 *         The b and B conversion specifiers never take a width
 *         modifier and always assume their argument is a 64 bit
 *         integer.
 *         Generally, these modifiers are not useful. They are
 *         ignored when type is known from the argument.
 *
 * i       alias for d
 * D       alias for ld
 * U       alias for lu
 * O       alias for lo
 *
 * c       The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
 *         resulting character is written.
 *
 * s       The text of the String argument is used.  If a
 *         precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
 *         specified are used.
 *         If the argument is not a String type, it is
 *         automatically converted to text with the same format
 *         as ":echo".
 *
 * S       The text of the String argument is used.  If a
 *         precision is specified, no more display cells than the
 *         number specified are used.
 *
 * f F     The Float argument is converted into a string of the
 *         form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
 *         digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
 *         zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
 *         is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
 *         (out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf"
 *         or "-inf" with %f (INF or -INF with %F).
 *         "0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan" with %f (NAN with %F).
 *         Example:
 *
 *             echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
 *
 *                 12.12
 *         Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
 *         Use `round()` when in doubt.
 *
 * e E     The Float argument is converted into a string of the
 *         form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
 *         precision specifies the number of digits after the
 *         decimal point, like with 'f'.
 *
 * g G     The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
 *         value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
 *         (exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
 *         for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
 *         zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
 *         immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
 *         results in 1.0e7.
 *
 * %       A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
 *         complete conversion specification is "%%".
 *
 * When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
 * accepted and automatically converted.
 * When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
 * is also accepted and automatically converted.
 * Any other argument type results in an error message.
 *
 * The number of **{exprN}** arguments must exactly match the number
 * of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
 * arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.
 *
 * In certain languages, error and informative messages are
 * more readable when the order of words is different from the
 * corresponding message in English. To accommodate translations
 * having a different word order, positional arguments may be
 * used to indicate this. For instance:
 *
 *     #, c-format
 *     msgid "%s returning %s"
 *     msgstr "waarde %2$s komt terug van %1$s"
 *
 * In this example, the sentence has its 2 string arguments
 * reversed in the output.
 *
 *     echo printf(
 *         "In The Netherlands, vim's creator's name is: %1$s %2$s",
 *         "Bram", "Moolenaar")
 *
 *     In The Netherlands, vim's creator's name is: Bram Moolenaar
 *
 *     echo printf(
 *         "In Belgium, vim's creator's name is: %2$s %1$s",
 *         "Bram", "Moolenaar")
 *
 *     In Belgium, vim's creator's name is: Moolenaar Bram
 *
 * Width (and precision) can be specified using the '*' specifier.
 * In this case, you must specify the field width position in the
 * argument list.
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$*2$.*3$d", 1, 2, 3)
 *
 *     001
 *
 *     echo printf("%2$*3$.*1$d", 1, 2, 3)

 *
 *     echo printf("%1$*2$.*3$g", 1.4142, 2, 3)
 *
 *     1.414
 *
 * You can mix specifying the width and/or precision directly
 * and via positional arguments:
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$4.*2$f", 1.4142135, 6)
 *
 *     1.414214
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$*2$.4f", 1.4142135, 6)
 *
 *     1.4142
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$*2$.*3$f", 1.4142135, 6, 2)
 *
 *       1.41
 *
 * You will get an overflow error `E1510`, when the field-width
 * or precision will result in a string longer than 1 MiB
 * (1024*1024 = 1048576) chars.
 *
 * You cannot mix positional and non-positional arguments:
 *
 *     echo printf("%s%1$s", "One", "Two")
 *
 *     E1500: Cannot mix positional and non-positional arguments:
 *     %s%1$s
 *
 * You cannot skip a positional argument in a format string:
 *
 *     echo printf("%3$s%1$s", "One", "Two", "Three")
 *
 *     E1501: format argument 2 unused in $-style format:
 *     %3$s%1$s
 *
 * You can re-use a [field-width] (or [precision]) argument:
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$d at width %2$d is: %01$*2$d", 1, 2)
 *
 *     1 at width 2 is: 01
 *
 * However, you can't use it as a different type:
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$d at width %2$ld is: %01$*2$d", 1, 2)
 *
 *     E1502: Positional argument 2 used as field width reused as
 *     different type: long int/int
 *
 * When a positional argument is used, but not the correct number
 * or arguments is given, an error is raised:
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$d at width %2$d is: %01$*2$.*3$d", 1, 2)
 *
 *     E1503: Positional argument 3 out of bounds: %1$d at width
 *     %2$d is: %01$*2$.*3$d
 *
 * Only the first error is reported:
 *
 *     echo printf("%01$*2$.*3$d %4$d", 1, 2)
 *
 *     E1503: Positional argument 3 out of bounds: %01$*2$.*3$d
 *     %4$d
 *
 * A positional argument can be used more than once:
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$s %2$s %1$s", "One", "Two")
 *
 *     One Two One
 *
 * However, you can't use a different type the second time:
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$s %2$s %1$d", "One", "Two")
 *
 *     E1504: Positional argument 1 type used inconsistently:
 *     int/string
 *
 * Various other errors that lead to a format string being
 * wrongly formatted lead to:
 *
 *     echo printf("%1$d at width %2$d is: %01$*2$.3$d", 1, 2)
 *
 *     E1505: Invalid format specifier: %1$d at width %2$d is:
 *     %01$*2$.3$d
 *
 * This internal error indicates that the logic to parse a
 * positional format argument ran into a problem that couldn't be
 * otherwise reported.  Please file a bug against Vim if you run
 * into this, copying the exact format string and parameters that
 * were used.

/**
 * Search for regexp pattern **{pattern}**.  The search starts at the
 * cursor position (you can use `cursor()` to set it).
 *
 * When a match has been found its line number is returned.
 * If there is no match a 0 is returned and the cursor doesn't
 * move.  No error message is given.
 * To get the matched string, use `matchbufline()`.
 *
 * **{flags}** is a String, which can contain these character flags:
 * 'b'     search Backward instead of forward
 * 'c'     accept a match at the Cursor position
 * 'e'     move to the End of the match
 * 'n'     do Not move the cursor
 * 'p'     return number of matching sub-Pattern (see below)
 * 's'     Set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
 * 'w'     Wrap around the end of the file
 * 'W'     don't Wrap around the end of the file
 * 'z'     start searching at the cursor column instead of Zero
 * If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.
 *
 * If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
 * cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
 * flag.
 *
 * 'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.
 *
 * When the 'z' flag is not given, forward searching always
 * starts in column zero and then matches before the cursor are
 * skipped.  When the 'c' flag is present in 'cpo' the next
 * search starts after the match.  Without the 'c' flag the next
 * search starts one column after the start of the match.  This
 * matters for overlapping matches.  See `cpo-c`.  You can also
 * insert "\ze" to change where the match ends, see  `/\ze`.
 *
 * When searching backwards and the 'z' flag is given then the
 * search starts in column zero, thus no match in the current
 * line will be found (unless wrapping around the end of the
 * file).
 *
 * When the **{stopline}** argument is given then the search stops
 * after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
 * search to a range of lines.  Examples:
 *
 *     let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
 *     let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
 *
 * When **{stopline}** is used and it is not zero this also implies
 * that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
 * A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.
 *
 * When the **{timeout}** argument is given the search stops when
 * more than this many milliseconds have passed.  Thus when
 * **{timeout}** is 500 the search stops after half a second.
 * The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
 * giving the argument.
 *
 * Note: the timeout is only considered when searching, not
 * while evaluating the **{skip}** expression.
 * *only available when compiled with the `+reltime` feature*
 *
 * If the **{skip}** expression is given it is evaluated with the
 * cursor positioned on the start of a match.  If it evaluates to
 * non-zero this match is skipped.  This can be used, for
 * example, to skip a match in a comment or a string.
 * **{skip}** can be a string, which is evaluated as an expression, a
 * function reference or a lambda.
 * When **{skip}** is omitted or empty, every match is accepted.
 * When evaluating **{skip}** causes an error the search is aborted
 * and -1 returned.
 *
 * With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
 * first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
 * whole pattern did match.
 * To get the column number too use `searchpos()`.
 *
 * The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
 * flag is used.
 *
 * Example (goes over all files in the argument list):
 *
 *     :let n = 1
 *     :while n <= argc()      " loop over all files in arglist
 *     :  exe "argument " .. n
 *     :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the
 *     :  " first search to find match at start of file
 *     :  normal G$
 *     :  let flags = "w"
 *     :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
 *     :    s/foo/bar/g
 *     :    let flags = "W"
 *     :  endwhile
 *     :  update               " write the file if modified
 *     :  let n = n + 1
 *     :endwhile
 *
 * Example for using some flags:
 *
 *     :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
 *
 * This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
 * under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
 * returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
 * if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
 * line:
 *     if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif
 * the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
 * finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
 * without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
 * The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.
 *
 * Can also be used as a `method`:
 *
 *     GetPattern()->search()
 *
 * Return type: `Number`

/**
 * Search for the match of a nested start-end pair.  This can be
 * used to find the "endif" that matches an "if", while other
 * if/endif pairs in between are ignored.
 * The search starts at the cursor.  The default is to search
 * forward, include 'b' in **{flags}** to search backward.
 * If a match is found, the cursor is positioned at it and the
 * line number is returned.  If no match is found 0 or -1 is
 * returned and the cursor doesn't move.  No error message is
 * given.
 *
 * **{start}**, **{middle}** and **{end}** are patterns, see `pattern`.  They
 * must not contain \( \) pairs.  Use of \%( \) is allowed.  When
 * **{middle}** is not empty, it is found when searching from either
 * direction, but only when not in a nested start-end pair.  A
 * typical use is:
 *
 *     searchpair('\<if\>', '\<else\>', '\<endif\>')
 *
 * By leaving **{middle}** empty the "else" is skipped.
 *
 * **{flags}** 'b', 'c', 'n', 's', 'w' and 'W' are used like with
 * `search()`.  Additionally:
 * 'r'     Repeat until no more matches found; will find the
 *         outer pair.  Implies the 'W' flag.
 * 'm'     Return number of matches instead of line number with
 *         the match; will be > 1 when 'r' is used.
 * Note: it's nearly always a good idea to use the 'W' flag, to
 * avoid wrapping around the end of the file.
 *
 * When a match for **{start}**, **{middle}** or **{end}** is found, the
 * **{skip}** expression is evaluated with the cursor positioned on
 * the start of the match.  It should return non-zero if this
 * match is to be skipped.  E.g., because it is inside a comment
 * or a string.
 * When **{skip}** is omitted or empty, every match is accepted.
 * When evaluating **{skip}** causes an error the search is aborted
 * and -1 returned.
 * **{skip}** can be a string, a lambda, a funcref or a partial.
 * Anything else makes the function fail.
 * In a `:def` function when the **{skip}** argument is a string
 * constant it is compiled into instructions.
 *
 * For **{stopline}** and **{timeout}** see `search()`.
 *
 * The value of 'ignorecase' is used.  'magic' is ignored, the
 * patterns are used like it's on.
 *
 * The search starts exactly at the cursor.  A match with
 * **{start}**, **{middle}** or **{end}** at the next character, in the
 * direction of searching, is the first one found.  Example:
 *
 *     if 1
 *       if 2
 *       endif 2
 *     endif 1
 *
 * When starting at the "if 2", with the cursor on the "i", and
 * searching forwards, the "endif 2" is found.  When starting on
 * the character just before the "if 2", the "endif 1" will be
 * found.  That's because the "if 2" will be found first, and
 * then this is considered to be a nested if/endif from "if 2" to
 * "endif 2".
 * When searching backwards and **{end}** is more than one character,
 * it may be useful to put "\zs" at the end of the pattern, so
 * that when the cursor is inside a match with the end it finds
 * the matching start.
 *
 * Example, to find the "endif" command in a Vim script:
 *
 *     :echo searchpair('\<if\>', '\<el\%[seif]\>', '\<en\%[dif]\>', 'W',
 *                     \ 'getline(".") =~ "^\\s*\""')
 *
 * The cursor must be at or after the "if" for which a match is
 * to be found.  Note that single-quote strings are used to avoid
 * having to double the backslashes.  The skip expression only
 * catches comments at the start of a line, not after a command.
 * Also, a word "en" or "if" halfway a line is considered a
 * match.
 * Another example, to search for the matching "{" of a "}":
 *
 *     :echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW')
 *
 * This works when the cursor is at or before the "}" for which a
 * match is to be found.  To reject matches that syntax
 * highlighting recognized as strings:
 *
 *     :echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW',
 *          \ 'synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 0), "name") =~? "string"')
 *
 * Return type: `Number`

 *
 * 'r'     The items from the current quickfix list are replaced
 *         with the items from **{list}**.  This can also be used to
 *         clear the list:
 *
 *             :call setqflist([], 'r')
 *
 * 'u'     Like 'r', but tries to preserve the current selection
 *         in the quickfix list.
 * 'f'     All the quickfix lists in the quickfix stack are
 *         freed.
 *
 * If **{action}** is not present or is set to ' ', then a new list
 * is created. The new quickfix list is added after the current
 * quickfix list in the stack and all the following lists are
 * freed. To add a new quickfix list at the end of the stack,
 * set "nr" in **{what}** to "$".
 *
 * The following items can be specified in dictionary **{what}**:
 *     context     quickfix list context. See `quickfix-context`
 *     efm         errorformat to use when parsing text from

 *     idx         index of the current entry in the quickfix
 *                 list specified by 'id' or 'nr'. If set to '$',

 *     quickfixtextfunc
 *                 function to get the text to display in the
 *                 quickfix window.  The value can be the name of
 *                 a function or a funcref or a lambda.  Refer to
 *                 `quickfix-window-function` for an explanation
 *                 of how to write the function and an example.
 *     title       quickfix list title text. See `quickfix-title`
 * Unsupported keys in **{what}** are ignored.
 * If the "nr" item is not present, then the current quickfix list
 * is modified. When creating a new quickfix list, "nr" can be
 * set to a value one greater than the quickfix stack size.
 * When modifying a quickfix list, to guarantee that the correct
 * list is modified, "id" should be used instead of "nr" to
 * specify the list.
 *
 * Examples (See also `setqflist-examples`):
 *
 *     :call setqflist([], 'r', {'title': 'My search'})
 *     :call setqflist([], 'r', {'nr': 2, 'title': 'Errors'})
 *     :call setqflist([], 'a', {'id':qfid, 'lines':["F1:10:L10"]})
 *
 * Returns zero for success, -1 for failure.
 *
 * This function can be used to create a quickfix list
 * independent of the 'errorformat' setting.  Use a command like
 * `:cc 1` to jump to the first position.
 *
 * Can also be used as a `method`, the base is passed as the

/**
 * Set the register **{regname}** to **{value}**.
 * If **{regname}** is "" or "@", the unnamed register '"' is used.
 * The **{regname}** argument is a string.  In `Vim9-script`
 * **{regname}** must be one character.
 *
 * **{value}** may be any value returned by `getreg()` or
 * `getreginfo()`, including a `List` or `Dict`.
 * If **{options}** contains "a" or **{regname}** is upper case,
 * then the value is appended.
 *
 * **{options}** can also contain a register type specification:
 *     "c" or "v"        `characterwise` mode
 *     "l" or "V"        `linewise` mode
 *     "b" or `"<CTRL-V>"` `blockwise-visual` mode
 * If a number immediately follows "b" or `"<CTRL-V>"` then this is
 * used as the width of the selection - if it is not specified
 * then the width of the block is set to the number of characters
 * in the longest line (counting a `<Tab>` as 1 character).
 *
 * If **{options}** contains no register settings, then the default
 * is to use character mode unless **{value}** ends in a `<NL>` for
 * string **{value}** and linewise mode for list **{value}**. Blockwise
 * mode is never selected automatically.
 * Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
 *
 * Note: you may not use `List` containing more than one item to
 *       set search and expression registers. Lists containing no
 *       items act like empty strings.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *     :call setreg(v:register, @*)
 *     :call setreg('*', @%, 'ac')
 *     :call setreg('a', "1\n2\n3", 'b5')
 *     :call setreg('"', { 'points_to': 'a'})
 *
 * This example shows using the functions to save and restore a
 * register:
 *
 *     :let var_a = getreginfo()
 *     :call setreg('a', var_a)
 *
 * or:
 *
 *     :let var_a = getreg('a', 1, 1)
 *     :let var_amode = getregtype('a')
 *         ....
 *     :call setreg('a', var_a, var_amode)
 *
 * Note: you may not reliably restore register value
 * without using the third argument to `getreg()` as without it
 * newlines are represented as newlines AND Nul bytes are
 * represented as newlines as well, see `NL-used-for-Nul`.
 *
 * You can also change the type of a register by appending

 *
 * When **{how}** is given and it is 'i' then case is ignored.
 * In legacy script, for backwards compatibility, the value one
 * can be used to ignore case.  Zero means to not ignore case.
 *
 * When **{how}** is given and it is 'l' then the current collation
 * locale is used for ordering. Implementation details: strcoll()
 * is used to compare strings. See `:language` check or set the
 * collation locale. `v:collate` can also be used to check the
 * current locale. Sorting using the locale typically ignores
 * case. Example:
 *
 *     " ö is sorted similarly to o with English locale.
 *     :language collate en_US.UTF8
 *     :echo sort(['n', 'o', 'O', 'ö', 'p', 'z'], 'l')

 *     :echo sort(['n', 'o', 'O', 'ö', 'p', 'z'], 'l')
 *
 *         ['n', 'o', 'O', 'p', 'z', 'ö']
 * This does not work properly on Mac.
 *
 * When **{how}** is given and it is 'n' then all items will be
 * sorted numerical (Implementation detail: this uses the
 * strtod() function to parse numbers.  Strings, Lists, Dicts and
 * Funcrefs will be considered as being 0).  Note that this won't
 * sort a list of strings with numbers!
 *
 * When **{how}** is given and it is 'N' then all items will be
 * sorted numerical. This is like 'n' but a string containing
 * digits will be used as the number they represent.
 *
 * When **{how}** is given and it is 'f' then all items will be
 * sorted numerical. All values must be a Number or a Float.
 *
 * When **{how}** is a `Funcref` or a function name, this function
 * is called to compare items.  The function is invoked with two
 * items as argument and must return zero if they are equal, 1 or
 * bigger if the first one sorts after the second one, -1 or
 * smaller if the first one sorts before the second one.
 *
 * **{dict}** is for functions with the "dict" attribute.  It will be
 * used to set the local variable "self". `Dictionary-function`
 *
 * The sort is stable, items which compare equal (as number or as
 * string) will keep their relative position. E.g., when sorting

 * characters are replaced with SOH (0x01).
 *

 *
 * **{flags}** must be a String.  These characters are recognized:
 *

 *      last line in the file to end in a NL.
 *
 * 'a'  Append mode is used, lines are appended to the file:

 *
 *      Fails when not in a function.  Also see `:defer`.
 *
 * 's'  fsync() is called after writing the file.  This flushes
 *      the file to disk, if possible.  This takes more time but
 *      avoids losing the file if the system crashes.
 *
 * 'S'  fsync() is not called, even when 'fsync' is set.

 * Remove previously placed signs from one or more buffers.  This

 *
 * The **{list}** argument specifies the List of signs to remove.
 * Each list item is a dict with the following sign attributes:
 *     buffer      buffer name or number. For the accepted
 *                 values, see `bufname()`. If not specified,
 *                 then the specified sign is removed from all
 *                 the buffers.
 *     group       sign group name. If not specified or set to an
 *                 empty string, then the global sign group is
 *                 used. If set to '*', then all the groups
 *                 including the global group are used.
 *     id          sign identifier. If not specified, then all
 *                 the signs in the specified group are removed.
 *
 * Returns a List where an entry is set to 0 if the corresponding
 * sign was successfully removed or -1 on failure.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     " Remove sign with id 10 from buffer a.vim and sign
 *     " with id 20 from buffer b.vim
 *     call sign_unplacelist([
 *             \ {'id' : 10, 'buffer' : "a.vim"},
