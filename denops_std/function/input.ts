/**
 * The result is a String, which is whatever the user typed on
 * the command-line.  The {prompt} argument is either a prompt
 * string, or a blank string (for no prompt).  A '\n' can be used
 * in the prompt to start a new line.
 * The highlighting set with |:echohl| is used for the prompt.
 * The input is entered just like a command-line, with the same
 * editing commands and mappings.  There is a separate history
 * for lines typed for input().
 * Example:
 * 	:if input("Coffee or beer? ") == "beer"
 * 	:  echo "Cheers!"
 * 	:endif
 * If the optional {text} argument is present and not empty, this
 * is used for the default reply, as if the user typed this.
 * Example:
 * 	:let color = input("Color? ", "white")
 * The optional {completion} argument specifies the type of
 * completion supported for the input.  Without it completion is
 * not performed.  The supported completion types are the same as
 * that can be supplied to a user-defined command using the
 * "-complete=" argument.  Refer to |:command-completion| for
 * more information.  Example:
 * 	let fname = input("File: ", "", "file")
 * NOTE: This function must not be used in a startup file, for
 * the versions that only run in GUI mode (e.g., the Win32 GUI).
 * Note: When input() is called from within a mapping it will
 * consume remaining characters from that mapping, because a
 * mapping is handled like the characters were typed.
 * Use |inputsave()| before input() and |inputrestore()|
 * after input() to avoid that.  Another solution is to avoid
 * that further characters follow in the mapping, e.g., by using
 * |:execute| or |:normal|.
 * Example with a mapping:
 * 	:nmap \x :call GetFoo()<CR>:exe "/" . Foo<CR
 * 	:function GetFoo()
 * 	:  call inputsave()
 * 	:  let g:Foo = input("enter search pattern: ")
 * 	:  call inputrestore()
 * 	:endfunction
 * Can also be used as a |method|:
 * 	GetPrompt()->input()
